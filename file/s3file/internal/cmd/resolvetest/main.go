// resolvetest simply resolves a hostname at an increasing time interval to
// observe the diversity in DNS lookup addresses for the host.
//
// This quick experiment is motivated by the S3 performance guide, which
// recommends using multiple clients with different remote IPs:
//
//   Finally, itâ€™s worth paying attention to DNS and double-checking that
//   requests are being spread over a wide pool of Amazon S3 IP addresses. DNS
//   queries for Amazon S3 cycle through a large list of IP endpoints. But
//   caching resolvers or application code that reuses a single IP address do
//   not benefit from address diversity and the load balancing that follows from it.
