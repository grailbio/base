# RecordIO

A recordio file stores a sequence of _items_, with optional compression and/or
encryption.  Recordio also allows an application to generate indices.

## RecordIO file structure

The following picture shows the structure of a recordio file.

![recordio format](recordio.png)

A recordio file logically stores a list of *items*. Items are grouped into
*blocks*. Each block may be compressed or encrypted, then split into sequence of
*chunks* and stored in the file.

There are three types of blocks: *header*, *body*, and *trailer*.
These block types have a common structure:

    block :=
      number of items (varint)
      item 0 size (varint)
      …
      item K-1 size (varint)
      item 0 body (bytes)
      …
      item K-1 body (bytes)


### Header block

Header block is the first block in the file. Header block contains one item. The
sole item stores a flat key-value mappings of the following form:

    header item := List of (metakey, metavalue)
    metakey := value
    metavalue := value
    value := valuetype valuebytes
    valuetype := one byte, where
        1 if the valuebytes is a utf-8 string
        2 if the valuebytes is a signed varint
        3 if the valuebytes is a unsigned varint
        4 if the valuebytes is a IEEE float64 LE
    valuebytes :=
        For utf-8, length as uvarint, followed by contents.
        For other data types, just encode the data raw.


Note: we could have defined the header as a protomessage, but we also wanted to
avoid depending on the proto library. It would complicate cross-language
integration.

The user can add arbitrary (metakey, metavalue) pairs in the header, but a few
metakey values are reserved.

Key          | Value
------------ | -------------
trailer      | Bool. Whether the file contains a trailer block
transformer  | "flate", "zstd", etc.

TODO: Reserve keys for encryption.

### Body block

Body block contains actual user data.

### Trailer block

Trailer block is optional. It contains a single arbitrary item.  Typically, it
stores an index in an application-specific format so that the application can
seek into arbitrary item if needed.

Recordio library provides a way to read the trailer block in a constant time.

## Structure of a block

At rest, a block is optionally compressed and encrypted. The resulting data is
then split into multiple _chunks_. Size of a chunk is fixed at 32KiB.  The chunk
structure allows an application to detect a corrupt chunk and skip to the next
chunk or block.

Each chunk contains a 28 byte header.

    chunk :=
        magic (8 bytes)
        CRC32 (4 bytes LE)
        flag (4 bytes LE)
        chunk payload size (4 bytes LE)
        totalChunks (4 bytes LE)
        chunk index (4 bytes LE)
        payload (bytes)

- The 8-byte magic header tells whether the chunk is part of header, body, or a trailer.

  The current recordio format defines three magic numbers: MagicHeader,
  MagicPacked, and MagicTrailer.


- The chunk payload size is (32768 - 28), unless it is for the final chunk of a
  block. For the final chunk, the "chunk payload size" stores the size of the
  block contents, and the chunk is filled with garbage to make it 32KiB at rest.

- totalChunks is the number of chunks in the block. All the chunks in the same
  block stores the same totalChunks value.

- Chunk index is 0 for the first chunk of the block, 1 for the second chunk of the block, and so on. The index resets to zero at the start of the next block.

- Flag is a 32-bit bitmap. It is not used currently.

- CRC is the IEEE CRC32 checksum of the rest of the chunk (payload size, index, flag, plus the payload).

# Compression and encryption

A block can be optionally compressed and/or encrypted using _transformers_.  The
following example demonstrates the use of flate compression.

https://github.com/grailbio/base/tree/master/recordio/example_basic_test.go

Recordio library provides a few
standard transformers:

- flate (https://github.com/grailbio/base/tree/master/recordio/recordioflate)
- zstd (https://github.com/grailbio/base/tree/master/recordio/recordiozstd)

To register zstd, for example, call

    recordiozstd.Init()

somewhere before writing or reading the recordio file. Then when writing, set
transformer "zstd" in `WriterOpts.Transformers`. The transformer name is
recorded in the recordio header block. The recordio reader reads the header,
discovers the transformer name, and automatically creates a matching reverse
transformer function.

You can also register your own transformers.  To do that, add transformer
factories when the application starts, using `RegisterTransformer`. See
recordioflate and recordiozstd source code for examples.

# Indexing

An application can arrange a callback function to be run when items are written
to storage. Such a callback can be used to build an index in a format of
application's choice.  The following example demonstrates indexing.

  https://github.com/grailbio/base/tree/master/recordio/example_indexing_test.go

The index is typically written in the trailer block of the recordio file. The
recordio scanner provides a feature to read the trailer block.


# Legacy file format

The recordio package supports a _legacy_ file format that was in use before
2018-03. recordio.Scanner supports both the current and the legacy file formats
transparently. The legacy file can still be produced using the
`deprecated/LegacyWriter` class, but we discourage its use; its support may be
completely removed in a future.

The legacy file format has the following structure:

    <header 0><record 0>
    <header 1><record 1>
    ...

Each header is:

    8 bytes: magic number
    8 bytes: 64 bit length of payload, little endian
    4 bytes: IEEE CRC32 of the length, little endian
    <record>: length bytes

The magic number is included to allow for the possibility of scanning to
the next record in the case of a corrupted file.

For the packed format each record (i.e. payload above) is as follows:

    uint32 little endian: IEEE CRC32 of all the varints that follow.
    uint32 varint: number of items in the record (n)
    uint32 varint: size of <item 0>
    uint32 varint: size of <item 1>
    ...
    uint32 varint: size of <item n>

    <item 0>
    <item 1>
    ..
    <item n>

For the simple recordio format (not packed), indexing is supported via
the Index callback which is called whenever a new record is written:

    Index func(offset, length uint64, v interface{}, p []byte) error

    offset: the absolute offset in the stream that the record is
            written at, including its header
    length: the size of the record being written, including the header.
    v:      the object marshaled if Marshal was used to write an object,
            nil otherwise
    p:      the byte slice being written

The intended use is to instantiate a new Scanner at the specified offset
in underlying file/stream.

For the packed format indexing is a more involved due to the need to
identify the start of each item as well as the record. To this end,
the Index callback is called in two ways, and a second Flush callback
is also provided.

At the start of a record:

    offset: the absolute offset, including the recordio header
    length: is the size of the entire record being written (the sum of the
            of the sizes of the items and associated metadata), including
            the recordio header.
    v:      nil
    p:      nil

For each item written to a single record:

    offset: the offset from the start of the data portion of the record
            that contains this item
    length: the size of the item
    v:      the object marshaled if Marshal was used to write an object,
            nil otherwise
    p:      the byte slice being written
